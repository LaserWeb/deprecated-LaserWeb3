# LaserWeb

Check the LaserWeb/CNCWeb Google+ community (https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/115879488566665599508) for updates on the progress of the newest iteration of LaserWeb.

Donations to the developers to further things along are always welcome, but even if you can not contribute financially, if you use LaserWeb and like it, spread the word around. More users translates into more contributors which then allows for faster, feature rich development.

## Documentation:

We have a pretty detailed Wiki on [https://github.com/LaserWeb/LaserWeb3/wiki](https://github.com/LaserWeb/LaserWeb3/wiki) - with details of Installing LaserWeb, Common application Workflows, Firmware setup tricks, and help for setting up LaserWeb's settings


## Contact Us if you need help! We can't fix bugs if we don't hear about them (;

## Wishlist

If you want to contribute, the below are long standing community-requested enhancements, that a) we don't have time to code or b) don't know how to

* GCODE Optimiser - to cut down on G0 moves (something like http://parano.github.io/GeneticAlgorithm-TSP/)
* More Controllers! Help us code up the Marlin and TinyG interfaces
* Smoothieware Ethernet - is about halfway done - if you'd like to help, please continue on from https://github.com/openhardwarecoza/LaserWeb3/issues/16
* Rotary Support - initial groundwork is done - but needs a lot of work to be fully usable https://github.com/openhardwarecoza/LaserWeb3/issues/51
* Vendor specific enhancements (PAID WORK OPPORTUNITY) - there are a few vendor specific enhancements, that companies are willing to pay to get done... See the labels on the Issues page, for example Emblaser/DarklyLabs: https://github.com/openhardwarecoza/LaserWeb3/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22EMBLASER+%2F+DARKLYLABS%22
